## Development Process

Everything took longer than we originally aniticipated. We spent several picking our data set, brainstorming
different questions based on a variety of attributes of the data, and iterating through visualization ideas.

Include:
- Breakdown of how the work was split among the group members. 
- a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: 
  - Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application?
  - What aspects took the most time?
